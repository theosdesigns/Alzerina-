						<h3 class="terms-sub-title">
						PRODUCT PRICING
						</h3>
							<p>
							Product prices displayed on http://www.alzerina.com are quoted in 
							U.S. currency.  In rare cases information, including prices may 
							be inaccurately displayed on our Website due to system or 
							typographical errors. While we make every attempt to avoid these 
							errors, they may occur. We reserve the right to correct any and 
							all errors when they do occur and we do not honor inaccurate and 
							erroneous prices. 
							</p></br>
						<h3 class="terms-sub-title">

							correct and complete, (2) charges incurred by you will be honored 
							by your credit card company, and (3) you will pay the charges

						RESPONSIBILITY
						</h3>
							<p>
							The responsibility of Alzerina Jewelry and its affiliated 
							companies is strictly limited. Alzerina Jewelry shall not be

						<h3 class="terms-sub-title">
						PRIVACY POLICY
						</h3>
							<p>
							We respect your privacy. Therefore we never share or sell your

						RETURN POLICY
						</h3>
							<p>
							You may return most new, unopened items within 30 days of delivery

							the return is a result of our error (you received an incorrect or 
							defective item, etc.). You should expect to receive your refund 
							within four weeks of giving your package to the return shipper,

							This time period includes the transit time for us to receive your 
							return from the shipper (5 to 10 business days), the time it 
							takes us to process your return once we receive it (3 to 5 
							business days), and the time it takes your bank to process our 
							refund request (5 to 10 business days). If you need to return an 
							item, simply login to your account, view the order using the 
							"Complete Orders" link under the My Account menu and click the 
							Return Item(s) button. We'll notify you via e-mail of your refund 
							once we've received and processed the returned item. 
							</p></br>
						<h3 class="terms-sub-title">
						SHIPPING
						</h3>
							<p>
							We can ship to virtually any address in the world. Note that 
							there are restrictions on some products, and some products cannot 
							be shipped to international destinations. When you place an order, 
							we will estimate shipping and delivery dates for you based on the 
							availability of your items and the shipping options you choose. 
							Depending on the shipping provider you choose, shipping date 
							estimates may appear on the shipping quotes page. Please also note 
							that the shipping rates for many items we sell are weight-based. 
							The weight of any such item can be found on its detail page. To 
							reflect the policies of the shipping companies we use, all weights 
							will be rounded up to the next full pound.
